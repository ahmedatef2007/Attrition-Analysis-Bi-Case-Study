2. **Employee Satisfaction Analysis:**
   - Employees with lower job satisfaction levels and poorer work-life balance tended to have higher attrition rates.
   - Employees with lower job Involvement levels and lower Environmental Satisfaction levels tended to have higher attrition rates.
3. **Departmental Analysis:**
   - Certain departments experienced higher attrition rates compared to others.
   - Attrition rates varied across education fields and job roles in each department, with some fields showing higher attrition rates than others.
4. **Demographic Analysis:**
